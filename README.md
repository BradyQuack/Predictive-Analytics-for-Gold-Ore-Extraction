# Predictive Analytics for Gold Ore Extraction
View project: [Predictive Analytics for Gold Ore Extraction]()
## Project Description:
Task statement
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.

The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

You need to:

Prepare the data

Perform data analysis

Develop and train a model.
## Data Description:
The data is stored in three files:

gold_recovery_train.csv 
gold_recovery_test.csv 
gold_recovery_full.csv 

### Technological process

Rougher feed — raw material
Rougher additions (or reagent additions) — flotation reagents: Xanthate, Sulphate, Depressant
Xanthate — promoter or flotation activator;
Sulphate — sodium sulphide for this particular process;
Depressant — sodium silicate.
Rougher process — flotation
Rougher tails — product residues
Float banks — flotation unit
Cleaner process — purification
Rougher Au — rougher gold concentrate
Final Au — final gold concentrate
Parameters of stages

air amount — volume of air
fluid levels
feed size — feed particle size
feed rate
